## üîß Troubleshooting Tips

If you have issues logging in with SSO, try these steps:

1. **Clear Old Sessions**  
   - Sign out of Zoom completely on all devices (computer, phone, tablet).  
   - Then restart Zoom and try again from Step 1.

2. **Update Zoom**  
   - Make sure your Zoom app is up to date. Outdated versions may not support SSO login correctly.

3. **Use the Correct Domain**  
   - Make sure you entered `weber` (not `weber.edu`) for the company domain.  
   - It should read: `weber.zoom.us`

4. **Browser Pop-Up Blockers**  
   - If using Zoom in a browser, allow pop-ups ‚Äî the login redirect may be blocked.

5. **Still Having Problems?**
