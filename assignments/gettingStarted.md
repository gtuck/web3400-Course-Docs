## Developer Environment Setup & Configuration

### Overview
This assignment introduces the essential tools and technologies needed for server-side web development. You will set up a development environment that includes a GitHub account, GitHub Desktop, Docker Desktop, and Visual Studio Code. Additionally, you will learn to work with repositories and containers—key skills for modern web development.

### Objectives
- Get familiar with GitHub and GitHub Desktop.
- Understand Docker and containerization basics.
- Learn to use Visual Studio Code for development.
- Gain experience working with repositories and development environments.

### Requirements

1. **Create a GitHub Account**
   - [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) using your university email: `@mail.weber.edu`.
   - Complete your profile with basic details.

2. **Install GitHub Desktop**
   - [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and install it.
   - Connect GitHub Desktop to your GitHub account.

3. **Create a `web3400` Repository**
   - Accept the collaboration invitation sent to your `@mail.weber.edu` email.
   - Visit the [web3400 repository template](https://github.com/gtuck/web3400.git).
   - Click **Use this template**, select **Create a new repository**.
   - Name your repository **`web3400-Spr25`**. For example:

   - Add `gtuck@weber.edu` as a collaborator to your new repository: Go to **Settings → Collaborators → Add people**.

4. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and install it.
   - Explore its basic functionalities.

5. **Install Visual Studio Code**
   - [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.
   - Familiarize yourself with its interface and extensions.

6. **Set Up the Repository in VS Code**
   - Clone your `web3400` repository using GitHub Desktop.
   - Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
   - Build and run the container when prompted by the `.devcontainer` file.

7. **Alternative Workspace (Optional)**
   - Use **GitHub Codespaces** instead of local containers.
   - Start a new Codespace for your `web3400` repository directly from GitHub.

### Deliverables
- A screenshot of Visual Studio Code with the `web3400` repository open and the Docker `.devcontainer` running (locally or in Codespaces).
