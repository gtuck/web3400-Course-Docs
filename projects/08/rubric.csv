"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Database Schema","Three tables created: `post_likes` (post_id, user_id, unique constraint), `post_favorites` (post_id, user_id, unique constraint), `comments` (post_id, user_id, body, status ENUM, timestamps); all with proper FKs, indexes, and constraints",false,"Excellent","All three tables match spec with correct columns, data types, unique constraints, foreign keys, and indexes",10,"Good","Tables present with minor column/type/constraint mismatches but functional",8,"Poor","One or more tables missing or major schema errors",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Engagement Models","PostLike, PostFavorite, and Comment models extend BaseModel with correct $table, $primaryKey, $fillable; each includes required helper methods (existsForUser, deleteForUser, postsLikedByUser for PostLike; similar for PostFavorite; publishedForPost, postsCommentedByUser, allWithDetails for Comment)",false,"Excellent","All three models implemented with complete helper methods; controllers use these methods instead of raw SQL",10,"Good","Models exist with most helpers; minor gaps or one helper missing",8,"Poor","Models missing or lack helper methods; controllers use raw SQL",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Post Model Counter Helpers","Post model includes incrementLikes/decrementLikes, incrementFavs/decrementFavs, incrementComments/decrementComments using GREATEST(column-1,0) to prevent negatives; withEngagementBySlug returns post with engagement flags",false,"Excellent","All six counter methods implemented correctly; withEngagementBySlug loads is_liked_by_user and is_favorited_by_user flags",10,"Good","Most counter methods present; minor logic gaps or missing one method",8,"Poor","Counter methods missing or counters get out of sync",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Like/Unlike Routes & Controller","POST routes /posts/{id}/like and /posts/{id}/unlike implemented; PostEngagementController requires auth, validates CSRF, uses PostLike::existsForUser and PostLike::deleteForUser, updates counters, redirects correctly",false,"Excellent","Both routes functional with CSRF protection, proper model method usage, idempotent like action, counter sync",10,"Good","Routes work with minor CSRF/validation gaps or counter sync issues",8,"Poor","Routes missing, broken, or use raw SQL in controller",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Fav/Unfav Routes & Controller","POST routes /posts/{id}/fav and /posts/{id}/unfav implemented; PostEngagementController uses PostFavorite::existsForUser and PostFavorite::deleteForUser, updates counters, mirrors like/unlike pattern",false,"Excellent","Both routes functional with same quality as like/unlike; proper model method usage and counter sync",10,"Good","Routes work with minor gaps similar to like/unlike",8,"Poor","Routes missing, broken, or use raw SQL in controller",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Comment Create/Delete (Public)","POST /posts/{slug}/comments creates pending comments with validation (body required, max 1000 chars); POST /comments/{id}/delete soft-deletes (status=deleted); permissions enforced (owner or admin/editor can delete); counters update on delete if was published",false,"Excellent","Comment creation validates input, uses CSRF, creates with status=pending; delete enforces permissions, soft deletes, updates counter correctly; uses Comment model methods",15,"Good","Comments work with minor validation/permission/counter gaps",12,"Poor","Comment creation/deletion missing or significantly broken",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Admin Comments Moderation","GET /admin/comments shows comment list with filters (all/pending/published/deleted); uses Comment::allWithDetails; POST /admin/comments/{id}/publish sets status=published and increments counter; POST /admin/comments/{id}/delete soft-deletes and decrements counter if was published; role enforcement (admin/editor only)",false,"Excellent","Admin index uses Comment::allWithDetails with filtering; publish/delete routes enforce roles, use CSRF, update counters correctly; no raw SQL in controller",15,"Good","Admin interface works with minor role/CSRF/counter gaps",12,"Poor","Admin moderation missing or uses raw SQL in controller",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Post Detail View with Engagement","PostsController@show loads post with engagement data using Post::withEngagementBySlug; loads comments using Comment::publishedForPost; view shows like/fav/comment counts; logged-in users see like/unlike and fav/unfav buttons (toggle based on user state); comment list with user names and time-ago; comment form for logged-in users",false,"Excellent","Controller uses model methods (no raw SQL); view shows all engagement UI with proper escaping; buttons toggle correctly; comments display with form",10,"Good","Engagement displays with minor UI/escaping gaps or missing one element",8,"Poor","Engagement UI missing or controller uses raw SQL",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Profile Activity Tabs","ProfileController@show loads liked/favorited/commented posts using PostLike::postsLikedByUser, PostFavorite::postsFavoritedByUser, Comment::postsCommentedByUser; profile view shows Bulma tabs (Likes/Favs/Comments) with three panels displaying post lists; meaningful empty states; correct links to posts",false,"Excellent","Controller uses all three model methods; Bulma tabs render correctly with all three panels; empty states clear; links work; no raw SQL in controller",10,"Good","Tabs present with minor data/UI issues or missing one panel",8,"Poor","Activity tabs missing or controller uses raw SQL",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Code Quality & Security","Thin controllers using model methods for all database operations (no raw SQL in controllers); all views escape output with $this->e(); CSRF tokens on all POST forms; authentication required for engagement actions; authorization enforced (comment deletion, admin routes); counters stay in sync",false,"Excellent","Consistent MVC pattern; all controllers use model methods; views escape output; CSRF on all forms; proper auth/authorization; counters consistent",10,"Good","Generally follows patterns with a few minor lapses (e.g., one missing CSRF or escaping issue)",8,"Poor","Raw SQL in controllers, unescaped output, missing CSRF, or broken authorization",0
