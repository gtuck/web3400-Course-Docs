"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Database & Models","`post_likes`, `post_favorites`, and `comments` tables created with correct columns, keys, and constraints; `PostLike`, `PostFavorite`, and `Comment` models extend `BaseModel` and integrate with `Post` helpers for engagement counters.",false,"Excellent","All three tables match the spec (columns, FKs, unique constraints, indexes) and all three models exist and are used by Post/helpers.",20,"Good","Tables and models mostly correct; minor column/constraint mismatches or a helper not fully wired but overall functional.",16,"Poor","One or more tables or models missing, or serious schema issues that break engagement features.",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Likes & Favorites","Authenticated users can like/unlike and fav/unfav posts via POST routes; engagement stored per user in join tables and `posts.likes`/`posts.favs` stay in sync; UI exposes clear like/fav buttons and counts.",false,"Excellent","All four routes implemented with CSRF, per-user uniqueness enforced, counters updated correctly, and UI clearly indicates current like/fav state.",25,"Good","Core like/fav behavior works but has minor gaps (e.g., missing idempotency, small counter bug, or slightly unclear UI).",20,"Poor","Likes/favs not implemented, not per-user, or counters do not update reliably.",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Comments","Authenticated users can add and remove comments on posts; comments are stored with appropriate status and displayed on the post page; `posts.comments_count` remains consistent with comment actions.",false,"Excellent","Comment create/delete uses CSRF, validates input, enforces permissions, updates `comments_count`, and the post detail shows a clear, escaped comment list and form.",25,"Good","Comments mostly work but have minor validation, display, or counter-sync issues.",20,"Poor","Comment system missing or significantly broken (no storage, no display, or no permission checks).",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Admin Moderation","Admins/editors can review, publish, and delete comments from an admin screen; only authorized roles access these routes; moderation actions are CSRF-protected and keep counters in sync.",false,"Excellent","`/admin/comments` index lists comments with key metadata and filters; publish/delete routes enforce roles, use CSRF, and adjust `comments_count` consistently.",15,"Good","Admin list and actions exist but with minor role, CSRF, or counter issues.",12,"Poor","Admin moderation missing or largely non-functional.",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Profile Activity Tabs","Profile page shows Bulma tabs for Likes, Favs, and Comments that list posts the current user has liked, favorited, or commented on.",false,"Excellent","Profile view renders Bulma tabs and three panels using engagement data from the database, with meaningful empty states and correct links.",5,"Good","Tabs or lists present but missing one panel, have minor data issues, or lack clear empty-state messaging.",4,"Poor","No engagement tabs on profile or panels do not reflect real user activity.",0
"Project 08 - Post Engagement & Comments","Code Quality & UX","Implementation follows course MVC patterns (thin controllers, models for DB logic, safe views) and provides a reasonable user experience for engagement features.",false,"Excellent","Consistent MVC structure, no raw SQL in controllers, views escape output (`$this->e()`), CSRF on state changes, and UX is clear for likes/favs/comments/moderation.",10,"Good","Overall solid structure with a few minor style or safety lapses.",8,"Poor","Messy or insecure structure (e.g., raw SQL in controllers, unescaped user content, missing CSRF on key actions).",0
