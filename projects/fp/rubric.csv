Criterion,Points,Description
Project 08 Foundation Verified,15,"Started from completed Project 08 with engagement features working. PostLike, PostFavorite, and Comment models have helper methods. Controllers use model methods (no raw SQL in PostEngagementController, ProfileController, PostsController, Admin\CommentsController)."
Admin Dashboard Route & Controller,15,"Dashboard is routed through public/index.php via Router to Admin\DashboardController. Controller extends base Controller class. Uses proper MVC structure with no standalone PHP files."
Role-Based Authorization,15,"Dashboard requires authentication AND admin role. Non-admin users are properly redirected with appropriate flash messages. Admin users redirect to dashboard after login (not profile page)."
NEW Post Analytics Methods,20,"Post model includes NEW dashboard analytics methods: countFeatured(), averageLikes(), averageFavs(), averageComments(). All methods use proper prepared statements and return correct data types."
NEW User Role Counting Method,10,"User model includes NEW countByRole() method. Uses prepared statements with parameter binding. Returns correct integer count."
Thin DashboardController,20,"DashboardController uses ONLY model methods for standard queries (NO raw SQL for counts, averages, role counting). Complex dashboard-specific analytics (totalInteractions, mostActiveUser) may use raw SQL."
KPI Display & Dashboard View,20,"Dashboard displays all required KPIs: total/draft/published/featured posts, user counts by role, contact message count, engagement averages, total interactions, most active user. Uses view templating with layout and partials."
Recent Activity & UI Polish,15,"Dashboard shows recent contact messages and/or recent posts/users. Clean, professional UI using Bulma CSS. Navigation includes admin dashboard link (admins only). Footer includes site info and contact link."
Security & Best Practices,10,"All dashboard forms include CSRF tokens. All dynamic output uses $this->e() for XSS protection. Prepared statements used throughout. Continues security practices from Project 08."
Code Quality & Integration,10,"Follows MVC patterns consistently. Dashboard integrates seamlessly with existing Project 08 features. Professional-quality code suitable for production delivery."
