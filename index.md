## **Campus Policies**

### Course Fees
Course fees are designed to cover the costs of lab equipment maintenance and replacement, including desktop and server computer systems and software; consumable materials and supplies; and support for lab aides, student tutors, and online instructional resources.

### Academic Integrity
School of Computing policy dictates that any verifiable evidence of student academic misconduct, as defined and determined by the instructor, will result in:
1. An automatic failing grade for the class.
2. A report to the Dean of Students that will include the student's name and a description of the student's dishonest conduct.

As part of the student code (PPM 6-22), you are expected to be academically honest and ethical. Academic dishonesty includes:
- Cheating.
- Plagiarizing.
- Colluding with others to be dishonest.

- Giving, selling, or receiving unauthorized course or test information.
- Using a tool or other aid not explicitly permitted by your instructor, such as generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT), to complete assignments or exams.
- Infringing on others' copyrights and intellectual property.

Academic dishonesty can have serious consequences in the class and/or at WSU. If you borrow an idea, express it in your own language and cite the source.

### Creating a Supportive Campus
