## **Campus Policies**

### Course Fees
Course fees are designed to cover the costs of lab equipment maintenance and replacement, including desktop and server computer systems and software, as well as consumable materials and supplies. Additionally, the fees support lab aides, student tutors, and online instructional resources.

### Academic Integrity
School of Computing policy dictates that any verifiable evidence of student academic misconduct, as defined and determined by the instructor, will result in:
1. An automatic failing grade for the class.
2. A report to the Dean of Students that will include the student's name and a description of the student's dishonest conduct.

As part of the student code (PPM 6-22), you are expected to be academically honest and ethical. Academic dishonesty includes:
- Cheating.
- Plagiarizing.
- Colluding with others to be dishonest.
- Falsifying information.
- Giving, selling, or receiving unauthorized course or test information.
- Unless explicitly permitted for a given assignment, the use of generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to complete coursework is considered academic misconduct. If permitted, proper disclosure and citation are required.
- Infringing on others' copyrights and intellectual property.

Academic dishonesty can have serious consequences in the class and/or at WSU. If you borrow an idea, express it in your language and cite the source.
