Remember that attendance is just as important virtually as in the face-to-face option. During video conferencing, be present, avoid multitasking, and wait for your turn to speak and/or contribute to the class discussion. Be courteous and respectful of your classmates. As stated in the class recording policy, you may not record any segments and/or the full class unless you have authorization from the instructor. If you do not have the technology necessary for video conferencing, contact your instructor as soon as possible. This policy applies also to virtual office hours.

### Campus Policies

#### Course Fees

Course fees are designed to cover the costs of lab equipment maintenance and replacement, including desktop and server computer systems and software; consumable materials and supplies; and support for lab aides, student tutors, and online instructional resources.

#### Academic Integrity

School of Computing policy dictates that any verifiable evidence of student academic misconduct, as defined and determined by the instructor, will result in 1) an automatic failing grade for the class and 2) a report to the Dean of Students that will include the student's name and a description of the student's dishonest conduct.

As part of the student code (PPM 6-22), you are expected to be academically honest and ethical. Academic dishonesty includes cheating; plagiarizing; colluding with others to be dishonest; falsifying information; giving, selling, or receiving unauthorized course or test information; using a tool or other aid not explicitly permitted by your instructor such as generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to complete assignments or exams; or infringing on others' copyrights and intellectual property. Academic dishonesty can have serious consequences in the class and/or at WSU. Be sure, if you borrow an idea, to express it in language entirely your own and let the reader know the idea's source in a citation note.

#### Creating a Supportive Campus

At Weber State University, we celebrate and value all individuals of any race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, marital or parental status, age, disability, veteran or military status, or other identifiers. We demonstrate our commitment by nurturing a supportive campus and striving to honor a balance between freedom of expression and respect for others. Together, we will continually challenge ourselves and each other in an atmosphere of mutual concern, goodwill and respect.

#### Professionalism & Respect

The sense of human dignity and belonging of all members of the Weber State community is a necessary part of a healthy learning environment. Therefore, you should practice civil deportment, and avoid treating others in a manner that is demeaning or derisive in any respect. Diverse viewpoints and opinions are welcome in this class, and we will practice the mutual deference so important in the world of work when expressing them. Thus, while I encourage you to share your opinions, you will be expected to do so in a manner that is respectful towards others.

#### Core Beliefs

According to the student code (PPM 6-22), you are to determine before the last day to drop courses without penalty if any course requirements conflict with your core beliefs. If after reading the syllabus and class program you expect such a conflict, you should consider withdrawing from the class. If you find this solution unworkable, you may request a resolution from the instructor. This policy does not obligate the instructor to grant your request, except in those cases when a denial would be arbitrary and capricious or illegal. You need to make this request to the instructor in writing and with a copy to the department chair. Your request must explain the burden the class requirement would place on your beliefs. If you are not satisfied with the instructor’s resolution, you can voice a complaint, petition for a change, or make an appeal through the [student petition, complaints & grievances processLinks to an external site.](https://www.weber.edu/complaint/).

#### Harassment, Discrimination & Sexual Misconduct

Weber State University is committed to providing an environment free from harassment and other forms of discrimination based upon race, color, national origin, pregnancy, and pregnancy-related conditions such as childbirth, false pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or related conditions, (including recovery), genetics, disability (see PPM 3-34), religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, veteran, active military status, age (over 40 in employment discrimination), and other classifications protected by law.  If you have questions regarding the university’s policy against discrimination and harassment, or if you have questions about reporting discrimination or harassment, you may contact the university’s Office of Equal Opportunity (801-626-7537) or visit its website: [https://weber.edu/equal-opportunityLinks to an external site.](https://weber.edu/equal-opportunity).

#### Americans with Disabilities Act

If you require accommodations or services due to a disability, please contact [Disability ServicesLinks to an external site.](https://www.weber.edu/disabilityservices/default.html) (DS) in room 181 of the Student Services Center (Ogden campus) or room 262 Building D2 (Davis Campus). Disability Services can arrange to provide course materials (including this syllabus) in alternative formats upon request.

#### FERPA Rights

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the federal law that governs the release of and access to student educational records,  certain rights are given to students related to the management of their records. These rights include, 1) the right to inspect and review your educational record, 2) the right to request an amendment of your education record if you believe that it is inaccurate or misleading, and 3) the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in your educational record, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 

The following are directory items may be available to the public, if requested, unless otherwise deemed confidential by the student:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *   Name<br>*   Address<br>*   Telephone Number<br>*   Dates of attendance | *   Major (program of study)<br>*   Degree(s) received<br>*   Honors received<br>*   Full-time/Part-time status<br>*   Videos used for educational purposes at WSU |

#### Student Responsibilities

As a student at Weber State University, you are expected to act responsibly and appropriately as you attend a public institution of higher education. When you enroll as a student at WSU, you agree to abide by the standards of appropriate and responsible behavior outlined in the student code (PPM 6-22). This applies to your behavior as an individual when participating in group settings on campus and if you represent Weber State University at an off-campus event. Choosing to ignore these important student responsibilities could result in university disciplinary actions.

#### Threatening Behaviors

Threatening behavior is deliberate, hostile conduct which would cause a person to fear injury or harm. It includes aggressive actions such as yelling, kicking, insulting, demeaning, bullying, intimidating, pounding on desks, slamming doors, blocking or cornering, and issuing threatening or disparaging voice-mails, e-mails, or other written intimidating remarks. Threatening behavior will not be tolerated in this class. If you’ve been exposed to threatening behavior, contact the office of the Dean of Students.

#### Recording

The university prohibits students from recording class lectures unless the faculty member grants explicit permission (PPM 6-22.6.6). Any lectures recorded and posted on Canvas or shared to your Weber State University student email are for the exclusive use of students enrolled in the class and may not be shared without previous authorization. Violations will be referred to the Dean of Students for adjudication under the student code (PPM 6-22).
